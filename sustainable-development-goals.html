        <h3>How to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all</h3>
        
                <p>Sustainable Development Goal seven (SDG) is : Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all</p>
                
                <p>Between 1990 and 2010, the number of people with access to electricity has increased by 1.7 billion, and as the global population continues to rise so will the demand for cheap energy. A global economy reliant on fossil fuels and the increase of greenhouse gas emissions is creating drastic changes to our climate system. This is having a visible impact on every continent.</p>
                
                <p>However, there has been a new drive to encourage alternative energy sources, and in 2011 renewable energy accounted for more than 20 percent of global power generated. Still one in five people lack access to electricity, and as the demand continues to rise there needs to be a substantial increase in the production of renewable energy across the world.</p>

                <h3>Renewable Energy</h3><img src="assets/images/solar-panels.jpg" style="width:400px;height:200px">
                
                <p>In order to acheive SDG7, there needs to be an increase in investment on renewable energy</p>
                
                <p>Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services.</p>
                
                <p>In 2014, renewable energy accounted for 19 percent of the total global world use. The most widely used source of energy is from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels release harmful substances into the environment and are the leading cause for climate change. Fossil fuels are also finite, therefore there is a need to shift to renewable sources of energy.</p>
                
                <p>Though fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, renewable sources of energy also have their drawbacks. Renewable sources of energy generally do not produce as much energy as fossil fuels. For example, in order to generate electricity using solar panels, hundreds of solar panels would be recquired to produce the same energy as would be obtained from 100 kilograms of coal. Renewable sources of energy also rely on environmental conditions. For example in 2007, a lack of rainfall resulted in low water levels in rivers and lakes in Albania, severely hampering hydropower generation and resulting in frequent power outages across the country. Outages amounted to 3.7 hours per day that year.</p>
                
                <p>It is up to governments and companies from all over the world to conduct research on how to improve renewable sources of energy to make them more efficient and reliable</p>

                <h3>Business practices</h3><img src="assets/images/energy_saving.png" style="width:400px;height:200px;">
                
                <p>Businesses should adopt energy efficient practices. They can do this by auditing their systems and looking for processes that waste a lot of energy. For example, businesses that use refrigeration facilities can replace old inefficient refrigerators. Businesses that produce toxic waste should find clean ways of dealing with their waste.</p>

                <h3>Government Policies and Regulation</h3>
                
                <p>Governments should adopt policies that encourage the use of sustainable forms of energy. For example, in developed countries the construction of bike lanes in cities encourage the use of bicycles as a means of transport. Another example is the implementation of congestion charges in the city of London. Congestion charges is a daily charge for driving a vehicle within certain zones in the city. This encourages people to use public transport or cycle. Governments should also regulate the amount of waste produced by industries and businesses.</p>
